## üôè Acknowledgements

* The concept of Agents, as implemented in this AI coder, is inspired by and builds upon the principles of modular AI design and agent-based systems. Specifically, the approach to creating agents from scratch, 
  without relying on LLM frameworks, is acknowledged to be influenced by the ideas presented in the following Research paper:

  **REACT: SYNERGIZING REASONING AND ACTING IN LANGUAGE MODELS** [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629) 

  This research paper provided valuable insights into building agents, which has informed the design and implementation of the `Agent` class and specialized agents within this project. I appreciate all authors 
  for sharing their knowledge and contributing to the understanding of agent-based AI systems.


*  The concept of use of ingestion of file structure of whole repository was taken from the source code of this project 

   **cyclotruc/gitingest** [here](https://github.com/cyclotruc/gitingest)

   This repository's source code provided an important base for file ingestion to create project states in vitex and gitrepo mode of 11ku7-ai-coder.
